Watch our video: https://youtu.be/zOW5E1oHc_g

Long-distance is challenging for any relationship, whether romantic, platonic, or familial. The lack of physical presence often leads to feelings of disconnect and loneliness. Current solutions, such as video calls and messaging apps, lack the depth and immersion needed to truly feel connected. The most crucial aspect of a relationship, shared activities and involvement of senses in addition to just sight and sound, are often the hardest to achieve from a distance. 

This Valentine‚Äôs weekend, we present to you‚Ä¶ VR-TINES! üíóVR-TINES is an innovative VR experience designed to enhance long-distance relationships through immersive, interactive, and emotionally fulfilling activities.

## ‚≠ê Key Experience Points
- **Collaborative Scrapbooking**: Couples can work together on a scrapbook, flipping through pages and dragging in photos and various decorative elements. This scrapbook feels like you‚Äôre actually working on it in the real world due to its alignment with 3d surfaces and interactive elements of flipping pages and dragging in elements. By having your partner right next to you, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre working on it together in this shared space. Love to reflect on the mems :)
- **Shared Taste**: Get a themed-meal at the same time! Here, we use the two users‚Äô favorite boba orders. Using the Doordash API, we synchronize the delivery of identical beverages or snacks to both partners during their VR date, which we track in the Doordash delivery simulator.
- **Enhanced Realism with Live Webcam Feed**: People typically use passthrough with VR headsets to feed what‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù into their experiences. We take advantage of this idea to stream a live webcam feed into the VR-tines experience, so it feels like your partner is actually sitting right next to you (and you see them in passthrough) as you do activities together! 
- **Tab Bar Navigation**: We support toggling through the three main options: scrapbooking, Doordash, and home.
- **Social Impact**: VR-tines is about bringing people together. Our project has the potential to significantly reduce the emotional distance in long-distance relationships, fostering stronger bonds and happier couples.
